### Remote development

If you want to quickly get started creating or editing a document, doing so remotely is the easiest option.

> Prerequisite: You must sign up for a GitHub account and login.

1. From the [bbyc-war-room repository](https://github.com/GabeStah/bbyc-war-room), press the period key (`.`) on your keyboard to open the repository in GitHub Codespaces.
1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/pages` directory (or edit an existing one).

   The file path represents the URL path. For example, `src/pages/about.mdx` will be available at `/about` while `src/pages/amirdrassil/goob.mdx' will be available at `/amirdrassil/goob`.

   > The majority of the file should be [written in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). However, you can also use JSX to add components to the page.

1. Once you're done, press `Ctrl+S` to save your changes.
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` to open the source control sidebar.
1. Enter a brief message describing your changes then select "Commit & Push."
